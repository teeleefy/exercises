## **Quiz**

- What is the difference between ***var*** and ***let***?
	Var declares a variable globally; you can access a hoisted variable with var. Let declares a variable with block scope. Var can be used to redeclare a variable.  Let can only declare a variable once.  
- What is the difference between **var** and ***const***?
	Var can be used to redeclare a variable, and the variable can be assigned a new value.  Const can only be declared once, and it cannot be assigned a new value. Also var can be declared without initializing it with a value, whereas, const has to be initialized with a value upon declaration.  With var, you can access a hoisted variable, but const creates block scope.
- What is the difference between **let** and **const**?
	Let's value can be changed by assigning the variable to a new value.  Const value cannot be changed by setting it equal to a new value. 
- What is hoisting?
	Variables declared using var are "hoisted."  They 'declare' the value at the top of the scope of the code.  If accessed higher in the code before it is officially assigned a value, it will just return undefined as its value.
